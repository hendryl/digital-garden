Most decisions, like 90% of them, are reversible. From those 90%, most of them are not worth thinking about due to [[Law of triviality]].

From those 90% that matter, we should decide after knowing 70-80% of the information. Getting more information takes too much time (See [[Pareto Principle]]), and might cause [[Analysis paralysis]].

The faster we can cycle through the [[OODA loop]], the better. But reversible decisions are not an excuse to act without thought. Be prepared to extract wisdom from the results if the decision does not work out
