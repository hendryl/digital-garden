# Deductive and non-deductive arguments

A deductive argument is an argument for which the premises are offered to provide logically conclusive support for its conclusion. This argument has both a true conclusion as well as true premise.

 A non-deductive argument is an argument for which the premises are offered to provide probable, *but not conclusive*, support for its conclusions.
 
Example of non-deductive argument:

> It’s cloudy today, so there’s a high probability that it will rain today.

## How are we to decide whether arguments are deductive are non-deductive?

The answer varies with context.

Mathematicians only accept deductive arguments, because they are after certain knowledge. Mathematicians are not going to accept arguments that are merely strong.

But in a court of law, we cannot only expect deductive arguments. It would be much too demanding and we would almost never be able to put criminals in jail. Instead, cases have to be established beyond reasonable doubt, so that we are very confident in our conclusions, even though we are aware that we might be wrong. We need to strike the right balance, as we don’t want it to be too easy to put people in jail either.

Part of the answer also lies in the [[Principle of charity]]. The idea is quite simple. Most people are not aware of the distinction between deductive and non-deductive arguments, and they may try and prove things (deductively) when a non-deductive argument would be much more suitable. In that case, the principle of charity tells you to treat the argument as being non-deductive.
