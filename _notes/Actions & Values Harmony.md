# Actions & Values Harmony

When your actions are out of alignment with your values, you can experience fear, guilt, frustration and emotional imbalance. 

Fortunately, you can get rid of those negative, unwanted feelings. You can either: 
1. Change your actions to align with your values, or 
2. Change your values to align with your actions.
