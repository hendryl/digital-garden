What is the goal of your product? The goal of your job? _Your_ goal?

When you know _why_ you're doing what you're doing, you can know if you're productive.

It's not about how busy you are. It's not about how much time you spend at the office. It's not about how many todo items you tick off the list.

Actions that move you and your company and team towards the goal are productive. Actions that don't, aren't.
