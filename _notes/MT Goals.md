M = Measurable
T = Timed

Simplified from SMART goals.

Why remove Specific, Achievable and Realistic?

You don’t need Specific, because if your goal/target is measurable, it must be specific (enough) anyway.

Achievable and Realistic are virtually the same. If you make the R Results-oriented, that’s pretty much there in Measurable.

Having only 2 points makes it simpler to understand, and simpler to focus on the most important points.
