# Reliance On Marketing

So, business need to differentiate itself from the rest. The least differentiable you are, the more reliance you are on marketing. Think, dish soap, ice cream, milk, gasoline, P&G, Uniliver stuffs. 

If your business is different already, your are not reliance on marketing. You solve problem better than others. If you are the latter kind. Your marketing effort has a quick diminishing of returns. But the management have different expectations. 

So you constantly trying, constantly showing, that you are not idle. You go in to new stuffs hoping that it will save your number, But really, you are not the deciding factor.
