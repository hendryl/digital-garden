[[The Goal]] should always be something that is productive for you / your department / your company.

Tips to figure out what goals to have:
_See what your organization has measured._
The things that are already measured are more important than stuff not measured yet.

_Take notice of your boss' concerns._
The things that worry them are what's important for them.
The projects that they want to know more are what's important for them.

As always, prefer [[MT Goals]] instead of all others e.g. OKR.
