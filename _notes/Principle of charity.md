Treat other people as intelligent people. If you treat people as being intelligent, you will do a better job at evaluating their arguments.

## Why be so nice?

You’re trying to work out what their argument is, not what the best possible argument for the position they’re running is.

There’s a limit to what you’re prepared to put into their arguments. You don’t want to turn an idiot into Einstein.

Still, there are several reasons to be charitable. For one, if you actually believe the conclusion of the argument, you want the argument to make a good case for it.

If you don’t believe the conclusion – you are better off attacking a stronger version of the argument. If you’re in a debate with someone and you attack a version of their argument which isn’t as strong as it could be, the person will just say: “That wasn’t what I meant. You’re not attacking my actual argument.” You won’t have gotten anywhere.

So you see things which say: so and so gives the following arguments for their position. There are some pretty obvious problems with it. But I can see how they would fix them if they’ve noticed. And so I’m going to fix the arguments for them. I am also assuming that they would have gone along with these fixes, as they are intelligent people. Sometimes, they don’t, of course

Then once you’ve got the argument as good as it can be, bearing in mind, you’re trying to evaluate their argument, not yours, you then say that even when repaired charitably, the argument is flawed in the following ways.

Then you’ve really shown something, namely that the best version of the argument won’t work. Showing that a hopeless version is bad, let alone a version that’s not even as good as the one they’ve advanced, doesn’t help.

Since our interest is in arriving at truth rather than simply winning arguments, then you should be charitable.
