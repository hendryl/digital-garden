If a society is tolerant without limit, its ability to be tolerant is eventually seized or destroyed by the intolerant.

In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant of intolerance.

> I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be unwise. - Karl Popper, _The Open Society and Its Enemies_
