# Design Patterns are not building blocks

Pattern is something that you use when you find that you've got a problem - you need some flexibility that the pattern provides, or that you've stumbled across when you are making a little language in the config file and you say "wait a moment, stop, this is its own interpreter that I'm writing - this is a known and solved problem, use an [Interpreter pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_pattern)."
 
 But note there, that it's something that you _discover_ in your code, not something you start out with.
 
 And thus, there's no "flow chart" that you use to find the right pattern. The pattern is a _solution_ to a specific type of problem that has been encountered again and again and the key parts of it distilled into a Pattern.
 
 The power of design patterns is in communication. It is much quicker for me to say "use a Strategy for that" than to describe in detail what I am suggesting. It is much easier for us to debate the benefits of fat domain models vs. transaction scripts if we all know what those two terms mean. And so on.
