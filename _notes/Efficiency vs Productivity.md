# Efficiency vs Productivity
Automation almost always improves productivity in one part of the system. But does it always improve _the whole system_? Nope.

Just because one part of the system is faster doesn't mean the whole system is faster and more efficient. This is often difficult to realize.

_YOU_ can never be more efficient than the whole system.

If you are, you're just creating overhead. Overhead is expensive. Stop working and go help the bottleneck.

If you're starved for work, you're just idling. Idling is expensive. Stop idling and go help the bottleneck.

## How do you find a bottleneck?

Where is WorkToBeDone piling up? Where does a process keep waiting for its inputs?

The place in between, that's a bottleneck.

### Slow down

Why are processes before the bottleneck working at full capacity? There's no point. You're just filling the queue.

Instead, have them slow down. Maybe even stop when the queue ahead is too full.

Why are processes _after_ the bottleneck working at full capacity? There's no point. They're throttled by output from the bottleneck.

Can you do parts of the process before the bottleneck? Anything that might reduce the queue going into a bottleneck?
